anecdotal evidence because they are based on data that is unpublished and usually personal

But I want evidence that is more persuasive and an answer that is more reliable. By those standards, anecdotal evidence usually fails, because:
Small number of observations: If the gestation period is longer for first babies, the difference is probably small compared to the natural variation. In that case, we might have to compare a large number of preg- nancies to be sure that a difference exists.
Selection bias: People who join a discussion of this question might be in- terested because their first babies were late. In that case the process of selecting data would bias the results.
Confirmation bias: People who believe the claim might be more likely to contribute examples that confirm it. People who doubt the claim are more likely to cite counterexamples.
Inaccuracy: Anecdotes are often personal stories, and often misremembered, misrepresented, repeated inaccurately, etc.
